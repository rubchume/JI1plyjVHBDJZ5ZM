# JobCandidatesRankingWord2Vec

## Summary

Created an algorithm to rank potential job candidates based on two criteria: search term and similarity to a candidate (based on job title, location and number of connections) that is manually highlighted as an ideal candidate

Used word embedding algorithms (Word2Vec and FastText) for computing the job title similarity and a geographic API for handling closeness of location
